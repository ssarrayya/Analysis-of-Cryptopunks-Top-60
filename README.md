# Analysis of Cryptopunks Top 60 Sales

This is the repository of the analysis of the Top 60 CryptoPunk NFTs by Selling Price. For a concise report, here's a link to the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@sarah-akinkunmi/analysis-of-the-top-60-cryptopunks-sales-e54f4accfd27) on the analysis.


## Purpose of the analysis
The objective of my analysis is to determine if there is a trend in:
1. The percentage of punk types in the top 60 sales by Selling Price
2. The percentage of attribute counts in the top 60 by Selling Price 

## Process
- [Data collection - web scraping](http://github.com/ssarrayya/ase-cryptopunks/)
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis and visualization

[![Dashboard of the analysis](/data-viz.png "Dashboard by Sarah Akinkunmi")](https://github.com/ssarrayya/Analysis-of-Cryptopunks-Top-60/blob/main/data-viz.png)

## Result
From the charts above, you’ll notice a trend: 
The rarer punk types have higher percentages in the top 60, however, the same cannot be said for the attribute counts. 

## Conclusion
Further analysis of each Punk’s attribute(s) may reveal the same trend as the Punk types.
